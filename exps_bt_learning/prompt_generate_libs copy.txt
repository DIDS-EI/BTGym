1. Generate behavior libraries for the behavior tree from the BDDL file, including all action nodes, in Python code.
2. Each action node should be a class named after the action, inheriting from 'OGAction'.
3. Each action node's 'info' dictionary should contain 'pre', 'add', and 'del_set' keys, representing preconditions, added conditions, and deleted conditions, respectively. 
4. These conditions are sets of predicates selected from [In, On, IsNear, ToggledOn, ToggledOff, IsOpen, IsClose, IsHandEmpty, IsHolding].
5. Each action node's 'valid_args' represents the action's parameters, should be a list of objects selected from {objects}.
