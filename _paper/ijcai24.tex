\section{Introduction}

% 我们想要引用的是huang2024rekep，该文章使用了VLM来输出时空约束，并结合底层的运动规划器来实现长周期的视觉规划



Our main contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We propose a hierarchical reasoning framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks, PDDL-VLM-Policy. 
    \item We propose a new long-horizon task planning network with action chunking, as well as the data collection pipeline and the dataset. With feedback.
    \item We train our model on the 10000 collected data, and evaluate it on 100 tasks, results showing that our model can achieve 90\% success rate.
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Code for Robot Manipulation}

some papers generate code for robot manipulation \cite{mu2024robocodex}. But these papers are not suitable for long-horizon manipulation tasks.

However, the current architecture of code generation for robot manipulation is not suitable for long-horizon manipulation tasks.

There are some paper use policy to directly control the robot, such as grasp \cite{wang2023dexgraspnet}. However, they face the problem of sim2real gap.


some paper uses VLM to output spatial-temporal constraints and combines the low-level motion planner to achieve long-horizon visual planning.
\cite{huang2024rekep,zhou2024codeasmonitor} however, these papers limited to the acurracy of keypoint labeling, which is not easy to achieve in real-world tasks.


guided the low-level motion planner with fine-grained eef-pose is a good way to achieve long-horizon manipulation tasks.
